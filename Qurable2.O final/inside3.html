                    <p>A relationship breakup, breakup,[1] or break-up[2] is the termination of a relationship. The act is commonly termed "dumping [someone]" in slang when it is initiated by one partner.[3][4][5][6] The term is less likely to be applied to a married couple, where a breakup is typically called a separation or divorce. When a couple engaged to be married breaks up, it is typically called a "broken engagement". People commonly think of breakups in a romantic aspect, however, there are also non-romantic and platonic breakups, and this type of relationship dissolution is usually caused by failure to maintain a friendship.</p>
